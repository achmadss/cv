# Profile
profile: |
  I am a software developer specializing in Android development with Kotlin and modern frameworks such as Jetpack Compose. 
  I have extensive experience building robust, user-friendly mobile applications, and a solid grasp of architectural best practices using tools like Koin, Dagger Hilt, Retrofit, OkHttp, and Coroutines.
  In addition to app development, I have a growing interest in DevOps and infrastructure, developed through hands-on experience self-hosting services and managing my own development environments. 
  This has given me practical insights into containerization, networking, and deployment workflows.
